# TODO

Deferred work, queued behind feature development.

## Test debt

### Unit / handler coverage

- [ ] Auth catch-all blocking lists (`server/api/auth/[...all].ts`): the
      `SSO_LOCKED` (change-email / passkey registration / 2FA enable for
      SSO-managed accounts) and `SSO_ADMIN_ONLY` (plugin's public sso
      register/update/delete) path guards are security-relevant and only
      manually tested. Extract the matching logic into a `server/utils`
      function (puts it under the 98% gate) or drive the handler via the
      sso-linking integration harness.
- [ ] Mail flows (forgot-password, delete-account confirmation): verified
      once by hand against maildev; nothing repeatable. The sso-linking
      harness pattern fits (pglite + production auth options + fetch-mocked
      SMTP transport, or assert on the `sendMail` calls).
- [ ] Admin SSO routes (register/edit conflict checks, sp-metadata for
      drafts, visibility, unlink-sso, sso-links): thin but admin-facing;
      a handler-level test file with a pglite db would cover the lot.

### E2E (the only one today is `pnpm e2e:smtp`)

- [ ] Identifier-first login: password reveal for local accounts, SSO
      redirect for captured domains, `/login?password=1` escape hatch.
- [ ] Signup domain-capture warning (continue anyway / use SSO).
- [ ] Password-reset mail flow end-to-end (request -> maildev -> reset ->
      sign in with the new password).
- [ ] Delete-account mail flow end-to-end (request -> maildev -> click ->
      account gone).
- [ ] Passkeys (needs a WebAuthn virtual authenticator; Firefox headless
      cannot - either chromium for this one test or skip).
- [ ] Prediction -> finalize -> leaderboard loop through the UI.
- [ ] Live WebSocket updates (crowd totals patch, live score + goal
      celebration).
- [ ] Real OIDC handshake against a disposable IdP (e.g. dockerized
      Keycloak/Authentik) - would also cover account linking and the
      password nuke in a real browser flow.

## Ops

- [ ] Nightly backup cron on the host (pre-1.0 checklist):
      `0 4 * * * cd ~/repos/nostragoalus && mise run db-backup`, outdir on
      a different disk than the Postgres volume.
